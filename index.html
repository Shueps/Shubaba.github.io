      <p>There was a little boy named <em>john</em>,<div> He was a 5 years old boy who lived with his family.<div> But every year a particular night when the moon turns red, all people whose name has the letter <A> in it suffers a pain and turns into a zombies, werewolves and vampires. Every one in John's family had a letter <A> in their in their name so John will have to run or hide away from home to prevent being harmed by his family, although for him not to forget he tags <em>the day on his calender</em>, even thought the thing is very common in his family and culture</p>

        <p>So one night the family decided to have their night in New York, John was forced to sleep in the darkest and scariest place in the the house. So a day before the night his parents forced him to follow them to New York but John refused, So his parent put him in their bag, When John woke up, he realised that he was in one of his parent's bag.


          <p>While travelling, they didn't bother to scan the bag beacuse the people who was scanning the bag was all scared of them, because there were vampires. When they got to New York, John was suffercated and his brother devoured him, After then (the next day) they came back to their right senses and they all realised that <em>John was devoured</em> and they really regreted themselves</p>
